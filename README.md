A Comprehensive &amp; Extensive Collection of Data Structures and Algorithms 

Software Requirement Specification:: 

Project :: A Teaching aid for a Data - Structures and Algorithms Course ;

Description : Our Project is an extensive collection of implementations of a lot of Data structures and associated algorithms which can be easily appended and used in projects.

Our Project will comprise of ::
Algorithms.h			::		The Core Collection of of implementations
installer.sh			::		An Installer for the header files and 
							associated documentation(Read:man page) 

List of implementations planned :: 
Basics ( Data Structures ~)
Graph Algorithms
Algorithms( Binary Search, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort,Heap Sort, QuickSort, Bucket Sort, ShellSort )
Hashing( Some standard widely used hashing algorithms )
Misc implementaions ( Polynomial / matrix/priority queue Etc.. Etc ..)

…
…… 
List to be expanded .
